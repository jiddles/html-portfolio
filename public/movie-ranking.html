        <h3>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</h3>
        <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_unbearable_weight_of_massive_talent"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWRNRfAGUI5SfJOD00rnVrK5H4ec9AS8XfQTue2q0GjXUbKLdn" alt="cover art for The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent" /></a>
        <p>This movie about movies has a funny script and great actors. The chemistry between Nicholas Cage and Pedro Pascal is just fantastic.</p>
        
        <h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
        <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/donnie_darko"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmlggjwdZM2gj7ItIsOvgBEUzsRT_hVl8hbw&usqp=CAU" /></a>
        <p>Everytime I think I understand this movie and then rewatch it there's something else I don't understand. That being said it's my favourite movie with time travel.</p>
        
        <h3>The Thing (1982)</h3>
        <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1021244-thing"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTjYgP_DV-sJWY-GqTtiBSTzYWtRrRAZQRWZvrYYJMOMUhEaDym" /></a>
        <p>A classic movie for a reason it's filled with suspense and paranoia, blending practical effects with intense psychological horror.</p>

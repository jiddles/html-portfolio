        <p>From a young age, I was drawn into the captivating world of video games. I couldn't help but wonder how these virtual worlds were crafted and how they came to life on the screen. It was this curiosity that ignited my journey into the realm of coding.</p>
        <p>I started tinkering with code, eager to understand the magic behind the games I loved. This exploration was the foundation of my passion for programming. However, I soon realized that I wanted a clear direction for my coding endeavors, a focus that could leverage my skills and creativity.</p>

It seemed like a natural fit, allowing me to combine my love for technology with the opportunity to create meaningful digital experiences. It was a choice that resonated with me deeply and set me on a path I'm truly excited to pursue.</p>
